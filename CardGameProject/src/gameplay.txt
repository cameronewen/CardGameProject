       Dealer deals two cards to each player. The goal is to have a hand that is closest to 21 points
       without going over. Face cards value at 10 points each. Ace can be valued at 11 points or 1 point. 


       To win:

              1. Draw a hand higher than the dealer, but lower than 22 (1.5x wager)
	      2. Dealer draws a hand over 21. (keep wager)
	      3. Draw a hand value of 21 on first two cards, dealer doesn’t. (1.5x wager)
              
       
       Lose: 
      	      1. Hand value exceeds 21.
              2. Dealer has a greater value than you at the end of the round.
              
        
       If neither the dealer or the player has a “blackjack”/21 points after first deal, 
       they choose how to play their hand.
       
       Options: 
       
		Stand: The players cards do not change, and the dealer moves on
			
		Hit: The dealer gives you another card. The player can choose to be hit as many times as 
		they want, as long as you don’t “bust” (card total goes over 21). The player can choose 
		to stand when they are satisfied with their hand.
			
		Double Down: If the cards look good, the player might choose to double their bet and 
		receive a single additional card. No more cards can be taken after this. 
		(in a physical game, the new card is turned sideways to indicate this)
			
		Split: If both cards the player received are of equal value (meaning royalty counts, 
		even if they are different types), the player can add a second wager, the same value as 
		their first and the two cards will become the first card in two new hands. 
			
		Surrender: The player gives up their hand for half their initial bet.
